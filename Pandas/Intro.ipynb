    "## Purpose and Motivation\n",
    "Pandas was created to address the need for a powerful, flexible tool to work with structured data in Python. Before pandas, Python lacked a robust library for handling data in a way comparable to tools like R or Excel. Wes McKinney, the original author, developed pandas in 2008 while working at AQR Capital Management to meet the demands of financial data analysis. The library has since evolved into a general-purpose tool used across industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretically, pandas serves the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Representation**: Provides intuitive data structures (Series and DataFrame) to represent and manipulate tabular and time-series data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Simplifies tasks like handling missing data, reshaping datasets, and transforming data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analysis**: Enables efficient computation of statistics, grouping, and aggregation on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interoperability**: Integrates seamlessly with other Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ease of Use**: Offers a high-level, user-friendly API that abstracts complex operations, making data analysis accessible to non-experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Data Structures\n",
    "Pandas is built around two primary data structures, which form the theoretical foundation of the library:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Series\n",
    "- A Series is a one-dimensional, labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integers, floats, strings, objects, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be thought of as a column in a spreadsheet or a single variable in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each element in a Series has an associated index, which acts as a label for accessing data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Theoretical properties:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Index**: A unique identifier for each element, allowing for fast lookups and alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Homogeneous data**: While a Series can store mixed types (e.g., integers and strings), it is typically used with homogeneous data for           performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Alignment**: Operations on Series automatically align data based on indices, simplifying computations."

    "#### 2. DataFrame\n",
    "- A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- It can be viewed as a collection of Series objects sharing the same index.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Theoretical properties:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Flexible indexing**: Both rows and columns have indices, enabling intuitive slicing and filtering.\n",
    "    - **Heterogeneous data**: Each column can hold a different data type.\n",
    "    - **Alignment and broadcasting**: Operations align data by indices, and broadcasting applies scalar operations across rows/columns."

    "#### 3. Panel (Deprecated)\n",
    "- Previously, pandas supported a three-dimensional structure called Panel for handling data with multiple dimensions (e.g., time-series across multiple entities).\n",
    "\n",
    "- As of pandas 1.0.0 (January 2020), Panel is deprecated in favor of MultiIndex DataFrames or xarray for multidimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theoretically, Panels were designed for \"panel data\" (data with observations over time for multiple entities), but MultiIndex DataFrames are now preferred for their simplicity and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Theoretical Concepts\n",
    "**1. Indexing and Selection**\n",
    "- Pandas relies heavily on indexing for data access and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Index objects**: Immutable arrays that provide labels for rows and columns. Common types include RangeIndex, Int64Index, DatetimeIndex, and MultiIndex.\n",
    "- **Selection methods**:\n",
    "    - **loc**: Label-based indexing (e.g., df.loc['row1', 'A']).\n",
    "    - **iloc**: Integer-based indexing (e.g., df.iloc[0, 0]).\n",
    "    - **at/iat**: Fast scalar access for single elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Alignment**: Operations between Series or DataFrames align data based on indices, preventing mismatches in calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Alignment and Broadcasting**\n",
    "- Pandas automatically aligns data based on indices during operations, ensuring that data points with matching indices are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Broadcasting allows scalar operations to be applied element-wise across a Series or DataFrame."

    "##### 3. Missing Data Handling\n",
    "- Pandas uses NaN (Not a Number) to represent missing values for numeric data, and None for object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theoretical methods for handling missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Detection**: isna(), notna().\n",
    "    - **Removal**: dropna() to remove rows/columns with missing values.\n",
    "    - **Imputation**: fillna() to replace missing values with a specified value or method (e.g., forward fill, mean).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Missing data is a core concern in data analysis, and pandas provides flexible tools to manage it without breaking workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. GroupBy Operations\n",
    "- The GroupBy mechanism allows splitting data into groups based on criteria, applying operations to each group, and combining results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theoretical steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Split**: Divide data into groups based on a key (e.g., column values).\n",
    "    - **Apply**: Perform an operation (e.g., sum, mean) on each group.\n",
    "    - **Combine**: Merge results into a new structure."

    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Reshaping and Pivoting**\n",
    "- Pandas provides tools to reshape data:\n",
    "- **pivot**: Converts long-format data to wide-format (e.g., creating a table with values spread across columns).\n",
    "- **melt**: Converts wide-format to long-format.\n",
    "- **stack/unstack**: Reshapes data using MultiIndex levels.\n",
    "- These operations are critical for transforming data into formats suitable for analysis or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Time-Series Functionality**\n",
    "- Pandas excels at handling time-series data with features like:\n",
    "- **DatetimeIndex**: A specialized index for time-based data.\n",
    "- **Resampling**: Aggregating data over time intervals (e.g., daily to monthly).\n",
    "- **Rolling/Expanding windows**: Computing statistics over moving windows.\n",
    "- This makes pandas ideal for financial, economic, and scientific applications involving temporal data.\n",
